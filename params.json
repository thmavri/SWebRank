{"name":"SWebRank","tagline":"SWebRank: A mechanism that performs semantic analysis on web documents, capture several semantic characteristics about them and generates quality new content. (Former LSHrank)","body":"### SWebRank (former LSHrank).\r\n***\r\nSWebRank is a Topic modeling mechanism (formerly entitled LSHrank - Latent Semantic Headless rank) that employs Content Semantic Analysis through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to generate optimal content analyzing web documents out of search engine result pages. It also evaluates the influence of webpage and semantic characteristics (such as Semantic Entities and Categories, namespaces, semantic triples) on the ranking mechanisms of major search engines always considering the domain of analysis.\r\n\r\n##More details are coming soon....for now check the Javadoc\r\n***\r\n<https://github.com/thmavri/SWebRank/blob/master/SWebRank_Javadoc.zip?raw=true>\r\n\r\n##Technical details & Important Library File\r\n* The project is a build with Maven and every dependency is in the pom.xml except the following.\r\n* DBpedia Spotlight jar is not in maven repository.\r\n* Download it from here: <http://bit.ly/DBpediaSpotlight>\r\n\r\n##Necessary databases\r\n***\r\n* MySQL database using the statements in the configuration files (you could possibly need to create the tables without the foreign keys first and then add them to work)\r\n* Elasticsearch to store the various content. The name used for the cluster in the project is \"lshrankldacluster\". You can use whatever you want as long as you change it in the project in the necessary files. For Elasticsearch all you have to do is to install it and set the cluster name in the Elasticsearch config files. The indexes are built automatically through the source code.\r\n* Elasticsearch guide : <http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html>\r\n\r\n##Sample Input and Configuration\r\n* Sample files can be find in the respective folders\r\n* The files should be .txt for the API credentials and the input.\r\n* The SQL commands are in order to setup the MySQL database. You may want to configure the tables without the foreign keys first.\r\n* The bare minimum for one to use SWebRank is the creation of an API key for one search API out of following search engines : Google, Bing, Yahoo!\r\n\r\n###Publications\r\n***\r\n* Exploring the influence of semantic data on the ranking mechanisms of search engines.
